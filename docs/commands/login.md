# The `login` command

The `login` command will log in to your Supported Source account. You will be prompted for your email address.

If you have never added a password to your account, you will then be prompted for a confirmation token sent to your 
email address, to complete log in. If your account does have a password, you'll be prompted for your password instead.

Usage:

`$ supso login`
