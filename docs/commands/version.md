# The `version` command

The `version` command outputs the current version of the Supso command line interface.
 
Not that it doesn't output the version of any Supported Source packages you may be using,
for instance the Ruby gem supported_source, or the Javascript package supported-source.

Usage:

`$ supso version
0.9.1
`
