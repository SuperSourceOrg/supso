# The `version` command

The `version` command outputs the current version of the Supso command line interface.
 
Note: this version is for the Suspo command line interface, not any Super Source packages you may be using,
such as the Ruby gem super_source, or the Javascript package super-source.

Usage:

`$ supso version
0.9.1
`
