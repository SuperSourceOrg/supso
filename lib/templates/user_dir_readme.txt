README FOR SUPER SOURCE USER DIRECTORY
------------------------------------------

This directory contains your user information for Super Source. If you've never heard of Super Source, it's probably being included from a project you're using.

Super Source is a platform for projects to learn who their users are. You can learn more about this at supso.org

To log out as the current user, get the supso command line interface, then run `supso logout`. If you're not even sure who you're logged in as, you can run `supso whoami`.
